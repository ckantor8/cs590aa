\begin{answer}{1}
% Design a linear-time algorithm to find an odd-length cycle in a directed graph.
\end{answer}


\begin{answer}{2}
% Design an efficient algorithm to determine, in a directed graph G = (V, E), whether or not there exists a vertex v âˆˆ V from which all other vertices are reachable.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{3}
% Design an efficient algorithm to compute the number of different directed paths from vertex v to vertex w in a directed acyclic graph G.

% input: v, w
% output: count_of_paths 

% topological ordering starting at (v)
% for each i=(2..w-1) see if there is a path (v-> ...-> i-> ...-> w) [
%   cf shortest path--we want to keep a count of all paths]
% add up the total number of paths


\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{4}
% Design a linear-time algorithm to determine, in a directed acyclic graph G, whether or not there is a directed path that touches every vertex exactly once.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Depth-first search
% \item Topological order (pop order)
% \item Check the topological order
% \item If 
% \end{itemize}

% a DAG has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices, in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path

% topological order is linear
