\begin{answer}{1}
% Counting heads: Given integer n and k, along with p1...pn âˆˆ [0, 1], you want to determine the probability of obtaining exactly k heads when n biased coins are tossed independently at random, where pi is the probability that the ith coin comes up heads. Give an O(n2) algorithm for this task. Assume you can multiply and add two numbers in [0, 1] in O(1) time.

Given a vector of probabilities $p$ of length $n$, we wish to compute the probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials, with probability of success $i$ in the $i^{th}$ trial. Obviously if $k>n$, the probability is zero. 

One (inefficient) way to go about this is to iterate over all of the possible subsets $S$ of $n$ that could offer $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures. For each of those subsets $s \in S$, we can multiply the probabilities of the successes ($s_a$), $\prod_{i \in s_a} p_i$, and the complements of the probabilities for the failures ($s_b$), $\prod_{j \in s_b} (1-p_j)$. This gives us the formula
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr(k \text{successes}) = \sum_{s \in S} \prod_{i \in s_a} p_i \prod_{j \in s_b} (1-p_j)
\end{eqnarray*}
However, there are ${n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}$ elements in $S$, which is quite large and makes this algorithm inefficient.

A more efficient approach uses recursion, alternating between addition and subtraction to avoid double-counting. Again, if $k>n$, we return zero. The base case of the recursion is $k=0$, in which case we return the product of all failure probabilities, $\prod_j=1^n (1-p_j$. For $0<k<=n$, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr(k \text{successes}) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^n ({p_j \over 1-p_j})^i Pr(k-i \text{ successes}) (-1)^{i-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

Notice that the inner term $\sum_{j=1}^n (p_j \over 1-p_j)=C$ is constant for a given problem, so we can compute it once at the beginning:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr(k \text{successes}) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} C^i Pr(k-i \text{ successes}) (-1)^{i-1}
\end{eqnarray*}

 We are then left with a sum of size $k$ and $k+1$ recursive calls. Using $n$ as an upper bound on $k$, this is $O(n \times n + n)=O(n^2)$, as desired.

\begin{answer}{2}
% Show that if P = NP then the RSA cryptosystem can be broken in polynomial time.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume $P=NP$. 
\item The factorization of large numbers, $F(n)$, can be verified in polynomial time, that is $F(n) \in NP$. $P=NP$ implies $F(n) \in P$. 
\item Suppose an adversary initially has the public key function $P(M)=M^e mod n$ for the message $M$, but not the secret key $S(C)=C^d mod n$ or the value of $n$. $S(P(M))=M=(P(S(M))$. 
\item If $F(n) \in P$ then $n$ can be factorized in polynomial time. Because $e$ and $d$ are small primes, the adversary can find $S(C)$ by trial and error (iteration) in polynomial time. 
\item Because $S(C)$ can be computed in polynomial time, the adversary can use the encrypted transmission $P(M)$ to compute $M=S(P(M))$. 
\item Thus, if $P=NP$, an adversary can break RSA encryption. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{answer}{3}
% A kite is a graph on an even number of vertices, say 2n, in which n of the vertices form a clique and the remaining n vertices are connected in a "tail" that consists of a path joined to one of the vertices of the clique. Given a graph and a goal g, the KITE problem asks for a subgraph which is a kite and which contains 2g nodes. Prove that KITE is NP-complete.

Recall from class that $CLIQUE$ is $NP$-complete. For $KITE$, we wish to find a clique of size $g$ connected to a tail, also of size $g$. 

If we are given a graph $G=\{V,E\}$ and asked to perform $CLIQUE$, we could reduce this problem to $KITE$. We could do this by adding tails of size $g$ to all $v \in V$. Then, the kite we find would consist of a clique plus a tail. 

Finding a polynomial-time solution to $KITE$ would imply a polynomial-time solution to $CLIQUE$.Because $CLIQUE$ is $NP$-complete and can be reduced to $KITE$, $KITE$ must also be $NP$-complete.
